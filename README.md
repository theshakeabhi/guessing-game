# Guessing Game

This web page is basically to re-enforce my DOM accesing and manipulation basics.

HTML and CSS were given as a base from this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course), and I am trying to code from scartch the functionality of it i.e JavaScript part of it.

[This is the production webpage of the game.](https://theshakeabhi.github.io/guessing-game/)

Feel free to point out in making my code more efficent and secure. Anything and everything is welcome!
